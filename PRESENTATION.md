## Agenda
1. Problem Statement
2. Data Overview
3. Methodology
4. Model Performance
5. Key Findings
6. Demo
7. Q&A

## 1. Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: Financial losses due to fraudulent transactions
- **Impact**: Billions lost annually across industries
- **Our Solution**: Machine learning-based detection system

## 2. Data Overview

### E-commerce Data
- 200,000+ transactions
- 9.4% fraud rate
- Features: Transaction amounts, user details, timestamps, device info

### Credit Card Data
- 284,807 transactions
- 0.17% fraud rate (highly imbalanced)
- 28 anonymized features + transaction amount

## 3. Methodology

### Data Pipeline
1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

### Models Developed
1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Baseline model
   - Fast training and inference

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble method
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Better performance overall
