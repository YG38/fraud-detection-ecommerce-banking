# Interim 1 Report: Fraud Detection Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This report presents the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the fraud detection project. The analysis focuses on two main datasets: e-commerce transaction data and credit card transaction data, along with IP address to country mapping.

## 2. Data Overview

### 2.1 E-commerce Data
- **Size**: 151,112 transactions with 11 features
- **Time Period**: January to September 2015
- **Class Distribution**:
  - Legitimate: 90.64%
  - Fraudulent: 9.36%

### 2.2 Credit Card Data
- **Size**: 284,807 transactions with 31 features (28 anonymized)
- **Class Distribution**:
  - Legitimate: 99.83%
  - Fraudulent: 0.17%

## 3. Data Quality Assessment

### 3.1 Missing Values
- No missing values were found in any of the datasets.

### 3.2 Data Types
- All data types are appropriate for each feature.
- Date/time fields in the e-commerce data were successfully converted to datetime format.

## 4. Key Findings

### 4.1 E-commerce Data Analysis
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is imbalanced with ~9.4% fraudulent transactions, which is relatively high compared to typical fraud rates.
- **Purchase Values**: Most transactions are of lower value, with some high-value outliers.
- **User Demographics**: 
  - Age distribution shows most users are between 20-60 years old.
  - Gender distribution is relatively balanced.
- **Traffic Sources**: SEO and Ads are the primary traffic sources.
- **Browsers**: Chrome is the most commonly used browser.

### 4.2 Credit Card Data Analysis
- **Severe Class Imbalance**: Only 0.17% of transactions are fraudulent, which is typical for credit card fraud detection.
- **Transaction Amounts**:
  - Most transactions are of small amounts.
  - Very few high-value transactions exist.
- **Time Distribution**: Transactions are evenly distributed over time.
- **Anonymized Features (V1-V28)**:
  - These are principal components resulting from PCA transformation.
  - They show different distributions between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

## 6. Next Steps

### 6.1 Feature Engineering
- **Time-based Features**:
  - Extract hour of day, day of week, and time since signup.
  - Calculate transaction frequency per user.
- **Geolocation**:
  - Map IP addresses to countries.
  - Calculate distance between user's typical location and transaction location.
- **Transaction Patterns**:
  - Calculate spending patterns per user.
  - Identify unusual transaction patterns.

### 6.2 Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Class Imbalance**:
  - Consider techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, or class weights.
  - For credit card data, anomaly detection techniques might be more appropriate.
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Apply standardization to numerical features.
  - Encode categorical variables appropriately.

### 6.3 Model Development
- **Initial Models**:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Random Forest or XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score rather than accuracy.
  - Consider business costs of false positives vs. false negatives.

## 7. Conclusion
This interim analysis provides a solid foundation for the fraud detection system. The datasets show clear patterns that can be leveraged for feature engineering. The severe class imbalance in the credit card data will require special attention during model development.

The next steps will focus on implementing the feature engineering pipeline and developing initial models, with careful consideration of the class imbalance issue.
